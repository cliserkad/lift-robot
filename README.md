# lift-robot

Based off drive2, used for a crane robot that moves things.

## Files
*main.cpp* is used for automated actions and may be edited freely if you wish to use drive2 as an add-on to an automated program.

*robot-config.cpp* is the primary file used for interpreting and enacting driver inputs. It is typically auto-generated code which has minimal computation, but has been heavily edited for better driving.
